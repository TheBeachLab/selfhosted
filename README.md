This is the story of how I am slowly becoming independent.

## Why am I doing this

My name is Francisco, in french it means "free person" . Some people in life want performance, some other want reliability. The only thing I care about is freedom. To do what I want, when I want and how I want to.

## What hardware do you need

You will be surprised how low-tech this whole thing can go. Of course the better hardware you have the longer you will travel. But for most common needs like website, mail and so, any computer from 10 years ago will be fine. You can even use a raspberry pi and carry your server in your pocket!! My server is a 2015 Skylake i3-6100 (2 cores/4 threads) @ 3.700GHz with 8GB RAM and 500GB SSD running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. It has a UPS power supply. The Internet line is a 600Mbps symmetric FTTH with dynamic IP address.

- TODO: Convert a powerbank to 12V UPS for the router using a [Pololu Adjustable Boost Regulator 4-25V](https://www.pololu.com/product/799/specs)
