# Selfhosted


## Why

My name is Francisco, in french it means "free", and that fits perfect in a person like me. This is the story of how I am slowly becoming independent.

## Hardware

My server is an oldie i3-3220 (4 cores?) @ 3.300GHz with 4GB RAM and 500GB SSD running Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS. It has a UPS power supply. The Internet line is a 600Mbps symmetric FTTH with dynamic IP address.

- TODO: Convert a powerbank to 12V UPS for the router using a [Pololu Adjustable Boost Regulator 4-25V](https://www.pololu.com/product/799/specs)
